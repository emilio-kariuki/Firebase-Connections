# Firebase-Connections 👓

This repo describes  an easy way to implement firebase services in flutter applications.Majority of the docs out there are either `outdated`🥴 `complex`😱 or just too wordy. Here we are helping solve that issue by providing a short, concise and easy method. If we look at all the code being used across majority of developers the architecture looks similar but how to implement it gets tough, what if we have an acceptable and yet brief way of doing the same and end up achieving the intended goal `ALL TESTS PASSED`🤪 or `BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY`🤩

OBJECTIVES

> 1. All tests passed successfully
> 2. Build Completed
> 3. Data was sent successfully
> 4. Notification sent to user
> 5. User has been authenticated

I know you are asking how this relates to `flutter and firebase`🧐 lets find out below.
